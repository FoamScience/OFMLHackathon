Editor Suggestions
******************


The editor that we suggest developers to use is VSCode. Below are some extensions that
could make the process of developing on SmartSim a bit easier.

 - GitLens, for viewing changes in the git history
 - Remote SSH, for connecting to clusters and supercomputers
 - Python, Microsoft Python Language Server
 - Python indent, for correcting python indents
 - reStructuredText, for writing documentation
 - Strict Whitespace, for ensuring no whitespace left in code
 - Python Docstring Generator, for writing docstring quickly
 - C/C++, for client development
 - Settings Sync, for syncing settings across remote servers
