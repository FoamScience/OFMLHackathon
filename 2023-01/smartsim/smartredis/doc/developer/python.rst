Python Guidelines
*****************

For the most part, the conventions are to follow PEP8 that is supplied by pylint. However, there
are a few things to specifically mention.

  - Underscores should precede methods not meant to be used outside a class
  - All methods should have docstrings (with some exceptions)
  - Variable names should accurately capture what values it is storing without being overly verbose
